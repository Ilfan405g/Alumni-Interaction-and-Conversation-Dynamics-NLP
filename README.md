# üöÄ Alumni Interaction and Conversation Dynamics NLP

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for "Alumni Interaction and Conversation Dynamics NLP"! This project delves into the world of chat engagement dynamics within an alumni WhatsApp group. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Sentiment Analysis, we analyze the conversations to uncover insights into the interaction dynamics. 

## Project Overview
The project utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and network analysis to reveal communication patterns, topic distributions, and participant interactions within the alumni group. By combining data science, machine learning, and statistics, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the alumni network's engagement with each other.

## Features
- **Topic Modeling**: Utilizing LDA to identify key topics of discussion within the alumni group.
- **Network Analysis**: Analyzing the network structure to understand participant interactions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Examining the sentiment of conversations to gauge the tone of interactions.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of communication patterns and topic distributions.
- **Python 3**: Implementation of the project is done using Python 3.
- **Anonymization**: Ensuring privacy through anonymization techniques in the analysis.
